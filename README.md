# Winnitron Launcher keep-awake

Despite all our best efforts, sometimes the Winnitron Launcher crashes. This script checks that process is running (the launcher writes its pid and executable path to a file on launch) and then restarts it if it's not running.

Ain't pretty but the more failsafes the better, I say.
